                    <input type="checkbox"files in a drive-letter-based hierarchy.>
                    <li>Uses backslashes (\) to separate folders.</li>
                    <li>The root of the system is typically C:\.</li>
                  </ul>
macOS
Uses a Unix-style file system with a single root (/), like Linux.</li>
Separates directories using forward slashes (/).</li>
Files and folders are located under directories like /Users, /Applications, etc.</li>
Linux
Also based on Unix principles, with a single root /.</li>
Uses forward slashes (/) for file paths.</li>
Directories like /home, /etc, and /var hold system and user data.</li>
Naming Conventions
Case Sensitivity
Windows:
  Not case-sensitive by default (file.txt and File.txt are the same).</li>
macOS:
 Usually case-insensitive, but case-preserving. However, it can be configured to be case-sensitive.</li>
Linux: 
Case-sensitive by default (file.txt and File.txt are different files).</li>
Naming Restrictions
Windows: 
Cannot use characters like \ / : * ? " < > |.</li>
Reserved filenames like CON, PRN, and AUX are not allowed.</li>
macOS:
 Cannot use : in file names.
Linux: 
Fewer restrictions. Only the / character is not allowed in file names.
File Systems
Windows: 
Primarily uses NTFS (New Technology File System).
Also supports FAT32 and exFAT, especially for USB drives.
macOS:
 Uses APFS (Apple File System) on newer devices.
Previously used HFS+.
Also supports FAT32 and exFAT for compatibility.
Linux: 
Uses ext4 as the most common default file system.
Also supports Btrfs, XFS, and others.
File Allocation Table (FAT)
FAT32 is still used today for removable media (USBs, SD cards) because it is supported across all major OSes.
exFAT is an improvement over FAT32 and is often used on larger external drives for compatibility.


Executable File Types
Windows:
.exe – Standard compiled application file.
.bat – Batch file used for scripting command-line instructions.
.cmd – Similar to .bat but works better with modern command-line interpreters.
.msi – Microsoft Installer package for application setup.
.ps1 – PowerShell script file, used with Windows PowerShell.
macOS:
.app – Application bundle containing all resources and binaries.
.command – Shell script executable via double-click or Terminal.
.sh – Standard shell script used in Unix systems.
Executables can have no extension, especially for command-line tools.
Linux:
Typically has no required extension.
Common extensions include:
.sh – Shell script.
.run – Self-extracting Linux program installer.
Executability depends on file permissions, not extensions.
Script Execution and Shell Access
Windows:
Uses Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and PowerShell for script execution.
Scripts like .bat, .cmd, and .ps1 are executed using these shells.
PowerShell provides more powerful scripting capabilities compared to Command Prompt.
macOS:
Uses the Terminal app to access the shell (typically zsh or bash).
Shell scripts (.sh, .command) are executed with the bash or zsh interpreter.
AppleScript is another option for automation.
Linux :
Scripts are run through the Terminal, using shells like bash, zsh, or others.
Shell scripts are executed by giving them execute permissions (chmod +x script.sh) and running ./script.sh.
Supports a wide variety of scripting languages including Python, Perl, etc.
